# PyTorch Basics - An Elaborate Introduction:

Welcome to the PyTorch Basics repository! This repository contains code for learning and practicing the basics of deep learning using PyTorch. PyTorch is a popular open-source machine learning library that provides a seamless path from research to production. It provides a flexible and intuitive interface for defining and training deep learning models, and has become a go-to tool for many researchers and practitioners in the field.

The code in this repository is organized into a series of Python scripts that cover a wide range of topics related to deep learning with PyTorch. These topics include:

- Tensor Basics: In this section, you will learn about the basic building blocks of PyTorch: tensors. You will see how to create, manipulate, and operate on tensors, and how to use them to perform basic mathematical operations.

- Autograd: PyTorch provides automatic differentiation capabilities through its autograd package. In this section, you will learn about the autograd package and how to use it to define and compute gradients for deep learning models.

- Backpropagation: Backpropagation is an essential algorithm for training deep learning models. In this section, you will learn about the backpropagation algorithm and how to implement it using PyTorch.

- Gradient Descent With Autograd and Backpropagation: In this section, you will see how to combine the concepts of autograd and backpropagation to define and optimize deep learning models using gradient descent.

- Training Pipeline: Model, Loss, and Optimizer: In this section, you will learn about the components of a typical deep learning training pipeline, including the model, loss function, and optimizer. You will see how to define and train a model using these components in PyTorch.

- Linear Regression: Linear regression is a simple and widely-used statistical model. In this section, you will learn how to implement linear regression using PyTorch and apply it to real-world datasets.

- Logistic Regression: Logistic regression is a generalized linear model that is often used for classification tasks. In this section, you will learn how to implement logistic regression using PyTorch and apply it to classify data.

- Dataset and DataLoader: In this section, you will learn about PyTorch's Dataset and DataLoader classes, which provide tools for efficiently loading and transforming data for deep learning models.

- Dataset Transforms: In this section, you will learn about PyTorch's transforms module, which provides a range of pre-defined transformations for data augmentation and pre-processing.

- Softmax And Cross Entropy: In this section, you will learn about the softmax function and cross entropy loss, which are commonly used in classification tasks. You will see how to implement these functions using PyTorch.

- Activation Functions: Activation functions are an essential component of neural networks. In this section, you will learn about various activation functions and how to use them in PyTorch.

- Feed-Forward Neural Net: In this section, you will learn how to implement a feed-forward neural network using PyTorch. You will see how to define the network architecture, forward propagation, and loss computation.

- Convolutional Neural Net (CNN): Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are a type of neural network that are particularly well-suited for image classification tasks. In this section, you will learn how to implement a CNN using PyTorch and apply it to classify images.

- Transfer Learning: Transfer learning is a technique for leveraging the knowledge learned by a pre-trained model on a large dataset to improve the performance of a model on a new task. In this section, you will learn how to use pre-trained models in PyTorch and how to fine-tune them for a new task.

- Tensorboard: Tensorboard is a visualization tool provided by TensorFlow that allows you to visualize the training progress and performance of your deep learning models. In this section, you will learn how to use Tensorboard with PyTorch.

- Save and Load Models: In this section, you will learn how to save and load PyTorch models, both in-memory and to/from disk. This is useful for saving the progress of a long-running training process or for deploying a trained model in a production environment.

- Learning rate scheduler: The learning rate is a hyperparameter that controls the step size at which a optimizer makes updates to the model parameters. In this section, you will learn how to use PyTorch's learning rate scheduler to adjust the learning rate during training.

The repository also includes the wine dataset and examples using the CIFAR and MNIST datasets. These datasets are widely used benchmarks in the field of deep learning and provide a good starting point for learning and experimentation.

- How to use the repo has been already mentioned in the above TLDR Intro.
