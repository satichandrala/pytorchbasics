# Pytorch Basics as a tutorial

This repository contains all the python code followed by the tutorials by Patrick Loeber from the playlist https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqnslRFeH2UrcDBWF5mfPGpqQDSta6VK4

# PyTorch Basics

This repository contains code for learning and practicing the basics of deep learning using PyTorch. The code is organized into a series of Python scripts that cover various topics such as:

- Tensor Basics
- Autograd
- Backpropagation
- Gradient Descent With Autograd and Backpropagation
- Training Pipeline: Model, Loss, and Optimizer
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Dataset and DataLoader
- Dataset Transforms
- Softmax And Cross Entropy
- Activation Functions
- Feed-Forward Neural Net
- Convolutional Neural Net (CNN)
- Transfer Learning
- Tensorboard
- Save and Load Models
- Learning rate scheduler

The repository also includes the wine dataset and examples using CIFAR and MNIST datasets.
